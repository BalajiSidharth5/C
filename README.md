# My-Coding-Journey

This repository is devoted to document the codes I write as I learn how to code. I use these tools while writing and testing my code: Git, VS Code, GCC, GDB. I have listed what I am working on below.

### Languages Familiar With (Basics)
  * C Programming

### Languages I am Learning
  * C++ (basics)
  * Python (basics)

I wish to get more advanced with my code soon after I learn C++ and python. I wish to use my coding experience to design circuitry and maybe apps to work alongside with it. The projects I build will be in a different repository on my page.

## Topics I have learned

This section will be updated regularly to real time.

### C programming
* Language Features
* Basic C concepts
* Makefiles
* Variables
* Data Types
* Basic Operators
* Conditional Statements
* Repeating code
* Arrays
* Functions
* Debugging
* Structs
* Character Strings
  
these skills translate well to C++ and python with some differences. Those differences, however, are very easy to pick up. Hence, The skills above translate to C++ and python.

### C++ 
TBD

### Python
TBD
